The datasets are stored in the `totaldata` directory. The `carhack` directory contains the source data used for training models:

- `dos_dataset.csv`, `fuzzy`, `gear`, `normal_run`, and `RPM` are the original datasets.
- `totalid_data.csv` is the preprocessed dataset used for training the `td` and `tp` models.
- `newtotalid_data.csv` is the preprocessed dataset used for training the `PTD` model.
- `train_data`, `val_data`, and `test_data` correspond to the training, validation, and test datasets, respectively.

Under the `data1` directory are datasets split for training, testing, and validation after training TD and TP models.

The B-can and M-CAN Intrusion datasets are located in their respective directories, following the same naming conventions as above.
